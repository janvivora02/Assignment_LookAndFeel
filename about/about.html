        </div>

        <p class="about-content">
            This assignment was really helpful for our team members as it gave us a different scope of learning. We had no prior experience of developing and designing the website. With the assignment we were able to learn and implement the learnings and are succesful in creating the website. Thank you for this assignment as we have learnt a whole new concept and are confident that we can create a new website on our own. It took us around 18-21 hours to learn and create the website. This assignment helped the team members to bond our the same interest that we share.As a feedback for future, this assignment should be given to the following classes.

            <p>Design Guidelines</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <ul class="about-content">
                <li>
                    <strong>Simplicity </strong>
        <p>
                While the look and feel of your website is important, most visitors aren't coming to the website to evaluate 
                how slick the design is. Instead, they're coming to the website to complete some action, 
                or to find some specific piece of information.

                Adding unnecessary design elements to the website will only make it harder for visitors to accomplish 
                what they're trying to accomplish.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Visual Hierarchy </strong>
            <p>
                Closely tied to the principle of simplicity, visual hierarchy entails arranging and organizing
                website elements so that visitors naturally gravitate toward the most important elements first.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Navigability </strong>
            <p>
                Having intuitive navigation on your site is crucial for ensuring visitors can find what they're
                looking for. Ideally, a visitor should be able to arrive on the website and not have to think
                extensively about where they should click next -- moving from point A to point B should be as
                pain-free as possible.
            </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
