            <p>Design Guidelines</p>

            <ul class="about-content">
                <li>
                    <strong>Simplicity </strong>
                    <p>While the look and feel of your website is important, most visitors
                        aren't coming to the website to evaluate how slick the design is. Instead, they're coming to the
                        website
                        to complete some action, or to find some specific piece of information.

                        Adding unnecessary design elements (i.e., elements that serve no functional purpose) to the
                        website
                        will only make it harder for visitors to accomplish what they're trying to accomplish. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Visual Hierarchy </strong>
                    <p>Closely tied to the principle of simplicity, visual hierarchy entails arranging and organizing
                        website elements so that visitors naturally gravitate toward the most important elements first.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Navigability </strong>
                    <p>Having intuitive navigation on your site is crucial for ensuring visitors can find what they're
                        looking for. Ideally, a visitor should be able to arrive on the website and not have to think
                        extensively about where they should click next -- moving from point A to point B should be as
                        pain-free as possible. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
